## ‚úèÔ∏è In short

> **Warning**
> This repo is supposed to be private. It could leave this state though for showcase purposes. If you ever get access to it please do not steal all the hard work !
>
> **We are definitively closing maintenance for this App. This repo will be archived soon.**

This repo contains all the source code and assets of the 2023 Gala Web App hosted by [T√©l√©com Physique Strasbourg](https://www.telecom-physique.fr/). There are two (main) branches here :

- `master` which holds the said source code
- `gh-pages` which is an _up-to-date_ clone of the [`./build/web`](build/web/) folder

Normally, you would find a release version of the web app running by [galapsbs.fr](https://galapsbs.fr) hosted by [ionos](https://www.ionos.com/). Alternatively, find a local version running by [Github Pages](https://thomasbyr.github.io/galapsbs/).

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Usage

Please make sure you have installed the required dependencies with :

```ps1
flutter pub get
```

Run a production version with the device of your choice with :

```ps1
flutter run -d <device> --release --web-renderer canvaskit
```

> **Note**
> Since some animations can be pretty heavy for some devices, we will use canvaskit as the renderer ; please make sure you load the web app with a WASM enabled browser !

## üíÅ Get Help

> [~~file a new issue~~](https://github.com/ThomasByr/galapsbs/issues/new)

This project is no longer maintained. Please refer to the latest [release note](https://github.com/ThomasByr/galapsbs/releases/tag/v1.8.1%2B7).

## üî∞ Support

You can find all the infos you want on the official [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) website. To release your app, take a look at the [specific](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web) documentation.

<details>
<summary>The app won't publish / show up ?</summary>

Well if you ever published your _own_ app on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), there is a weird thing with absolute / relative paths. Basically what you want to do is look for (or create) the tag

```html
<base href="$PATH" />
```

and replace it with

```html
<base href="./" />
```

Note that this bug only occures with GitHub Pages and that you will most likely not need to update the tag if you deploy the app on your own server.

<details>
<summary>There is a scaling bug between Android apk and Web js App</summary>

YES
