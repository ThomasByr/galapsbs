## ‚úèÔ∏è In short

> This repo is supposed to be private. It could leave this state though for showcase purposes. If you ever get access to it please do not steal all the hard work !

This repo contains all the source code and assets of the 2023 Gala Web App hosted by [T√©l√©com Physique Strasbourg](https://www.telecom-physique.fr/). There are two (main) branches here :

- `master` which holds the said source code
- `gh-pages` which is an _up-to-date_ clone of the [`./build/web`](build/web/) folder

Normally, you would find a release version of the web app running by [galapsbs.fr](galapsbs.fr) hosted by [ionos](https://www.ionos.com/). Alternatively, find a local version running by [Github Pages](https://thomasbyr.github.io/galapsbs/).

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Usage

Please make sure you have installed the required dependencies with :

```ps1
flutter pub get
```

Run a production version with the device of your choice with :

```ps1
flutter run -d <device> --release
```

## üî∞ Support

You can find all the infos you want on the official [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) website. To release your app, take a look at the [specific](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web) documentation.

<details>
<summary>The app won't publish / show up ?</summary>

Well if you ever published your _own_ app on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), there is a weird thing with absolute / relative paths. Basically what you want to do is look for (or create) the tag

```html
<base href="$PATH" />
```

and replace it with

```html
<base href="./" />
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>There is a scaling bug between Android apk and Web js App</summary>

YES

</details>
